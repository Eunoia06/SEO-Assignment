SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization 
It is a set of rules for optimizing your website to achieve higher rankings in search engine's organic results. 
The most important SEO tasks involve creating helpful content that will make users happy, promoting your website to gain search engines trust, and offering a great user experience.

The importance of SEO is multi-faceted:

1.Increase Visibility and Web Traffic : SEO can help you get free targeted traffic from search engines. If your website appears in the top positions for related searches, you're more likely to get a portion of the traffic.
2.Enhance User Experience (UX): Good SEO practices improve the user experience and usability of a website.
3.Build Credibility: Users trust search engines, and having a presence in the top positions for the keywords the user is searching increases the websiteâ€™s trust.
4.Social Promotion: People who find your website by searching Google or Bing are more likely to promote it on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media channels.
5.Smooth Running of a Big Website: Websites with more than one author can benefit from SEO directly and indirectly. Their direct benefit is increased organic traffic, and their indirect benefit is having a common framework (checklists) to use before publishing content on the site.
6.Competitive Advantage: If two websites are selling the same thing, the SEO optimized website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.
