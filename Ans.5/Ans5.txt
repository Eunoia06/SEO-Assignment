A favicon is a small, square icon associated with a particular website or web page. 
The term favicon combines two words: "favorite" and "icon". So, a favicon is your company's favorite icon. It's a symbol that represents your brand or website. 

Favicons are typically 16x16 pixels and are displayed in various places such as:
- Browser tabs next to the page title
- Bookmark bars
- Address bars
- Browser history
- Search results alongside the page URL

For example, if you open multiple tabs in your browser, you'll see small icons representing each website next to the page title. These are favicons.

Here's a simple illustration of how to add a favicon to your HTML:

<html
<head>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
